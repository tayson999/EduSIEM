Aggregate events into time windows (time-series)

Detect anomalies using statistical methods (z-score) and rule-based detection

Generate structured alerts in JSON and CSV formats

Be easily extended and configured thanks to its modular design

💡 Purpose: Learn how to process logs, identify suspicious activity, and build a simple security monitoring system from scratch.
